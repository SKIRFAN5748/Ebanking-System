Project Description:


The project aims to develop an online banking system that can be accessed by anyone. The system can be used to create a new bank account, to know about a bank, or to login a bank account. The basic entity for explaining all operations in the bank is the customer. The E-Banking service will allow customers to transfer funds between accounts of the same customer. To ensure a high level of security, the Banking service needs to provide a unique Personal Identification password. To simulate the Core Banking solution, a Test application needs to be built which contain the central Banking database.
